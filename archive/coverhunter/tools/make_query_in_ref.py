    Processes reference and query metadata to generate "query_in_ref" data,
    which is an index of perfs (performances) that appear in both data sets.
    Typical usage during training is to provide the training dataset as
    the query file and a test set as the reference file. If you use multiple
    test sets, you would want to generate a separate query_in_ref file for each
    test set (assuming there could be overlap of the same performances in both
    training and test data.)
    Note that this is irrelevant when using the same data for both training
    and test, such as in the default covers80 demo setup where covers80 is used
    as the only test set while training on covers80.

    Args:
        ref_file (str): Path to the reference JSON file.
        query_file (str): Path to the query JSON file.

    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples representing the query-reference mappings.
